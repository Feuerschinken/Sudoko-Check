# Sudoko-Check
The code should check whether or not the input is a sudoku correctly solved.
For doing so, the following three aspects are checked with a function:
(1)In every row the numbers from 1-9 appear a single time.
(2)In every column the numbers from 1-9 appear a single time.
(3)In every 3x3box the numbers from 1-9 appear a singel time.
